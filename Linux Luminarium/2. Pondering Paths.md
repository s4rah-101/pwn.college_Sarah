# Pondering Paths 

## The Root
The challenge was to understand and define a file path successfully.It also taught us about 'absolute path'.

### My solution 
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YEo6zs8xTQSY3R4C8d8WLEMOg-a.QX4cTO0wyN1QzNzEzW}`

By typing '/pwn' I could complete my goal of capturing the flag and hence completed the challenge of defining and executing a file path.

```bash
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{YEo6zs8xTQSY3R4C8d8WLEMOg-a.QX4cTO0wyN1QzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
I learnt how to write a file path in Linux. Since it is starting with the root directory, it is called as "Absolute path".

## Program and Absolute Paths 
The challenge was to understand and define absolute path. And how we can define the path for a challenge inside a directory. 

### My solution 
**Flag:** `pwn.college{04IlMfIbxnTwbd_WEeWRLfo6ai_.QX1QTN0wyN1QzNzEzW}`

By giving the command as '/challenge/run' I could complete my challenge. Firstly the program went o teh challenge directory and inside of that was the run challenge and hence this path is defined. 

```bash
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{04IlMfIbxnTwbd_WEeWRLfo6ai_.QX1QTN0wyN1QzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
I learnt how to make a program inside a 'challenge' directory.And how that is called as a 'absolute path'.

## Position Thy Self
The challenge was to understand and learn how to change directories in Linux and effectively navigate the path to a file.

### My solution 
**Flag:** `pwn.college{c1yDRaYNJycVfgmZfIiRcJ972Bv.QX2QTN0wyN1QzNzEzW}`

By giving the command as 'cd /challenge' I entered the challenge directory. Then when I typed '/challenge/run' it showed incorrect and guided me to a different directory whose path was mentioned in the command prompt. Navigating to the the path given I again retried the command '/challenge/run' and henvce got my result and received my flag.

```bash
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /challenge 
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/challenge$ /challenge/run 
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/challenge$ ^C
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/challenge$ cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/etc/apt/sources.list.d$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{c1yDRaYNJycVfgmZfIiRcJ972Bv.QX2QTN0wyN1QzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
I learnt how to navigate through directories and how to run commands in those directories. I leared the cd command that is Change Directory which helps us switch between different directories in a complex program.

## Implicit Relative Paths, from /
The challenge was to understand and learn the cwd command and how it works and how we change the current directory. 

### My solution 
**Flag:** `pwn.college{05441lt-kyeiHdtSYTqhsXpTNWB.QX5QTN0wyN1QzNzEzW}`

By giving the command as 'cd /' I entered the '/' directory. Then when I typed 'challenge/run' it showed Correct and and mentioned that it is a relative path from the right directory.

```bash
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/challenge$ cd /
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ challenge/run
Correct!!!
challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{05441lt-kyeiHdtSYTqhsXpTNWB.QX5QTN0wyN1QzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
I learnt how to navigate through directories and how to run commands in those directories. I leared the cwd command that shows the current status i.e. the directory that our prompt is located in.
