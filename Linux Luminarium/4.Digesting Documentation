## 
The challenge was to understand and learn the cat command which reads a file in Linux. It is one of the very important commands in Linux.

### My solution 
**Flag:** `pwn.college{svspNLRFvqDcre16IuXXXo-KDzp.QXxcTN0wyN1QzNzEzW}`

By typing 'cat flag' I could complete my goal of capturing the flag and hence completed the challenge of reading the file through the cat function. 

```bash
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag 
pwn.college{svspNLRFvqDcre16IuXXXo-KDzp.QXxcTN0wyN1QzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
I learnt how to call a file in Linux using cat command. It is one of the very important commands in Linux.
