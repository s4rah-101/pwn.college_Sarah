# Pondering Paths 

## The Root
The challenge was to understand and define a file path successfully.It also taught us about 'absolute path'.

### My solution 
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YEo6zs8xTQSY3R4C8d8WLEMOg-a.QX4cTO0wyN1QzNzEzW}`

By typing '/pwn' I could complete my goal of capturing the flag and hence completed the challenge of defining and executing a file path.

```bash
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{YEo6zs8xTQSY3R4C8d8WLEMOg-a.QX4cTO0wyN1QzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
I learnt how to write a file path in Linux. Since it is starting with the root directory, it is called as "Absolute path".
