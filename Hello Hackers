# Hello Hackers 

## Intro to Commands 
This challenge allowed us to learn the commands and type out our first command on pwn.college. We learnt about the basic starting commands in Linux.

### My Solution 
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Er3QjqO_HooM7j_VQgyzDPYOJUT.QX4YjM1wyN1QzNzEzW}`
By simply typing 'hello' in the command prompt we got the Flag and hence completed our first task. 

```bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{k67a4WQq_cDaiotf9CPCxJaJKUd.QX3YjM1wyN1QzNzEzW}
```

### My learnings 
We learnt how a terminal in Linux works and how with just simple and easy commands we can type out our input in Linux command prompt window.

## Intro to Arguments
This challenge allowed us to learn the commands and its respective arguments. A bit more complicated than the previous challenge, we learnt how Linux accepts the first words as a command and the subsequent words as arguments.

### My Solution 
**Flag:** `pwn.college{k67a4WQq_cDaiotf9CPCxJaJKUd.QX3YjM1wyN1QzNzEzW}`
The first step included typing'echo hello' which printed out hello. The echo command stored that.Next we typed 'echo hello hackers' giving an argument statement to the echo command. Itthen stored the new output. Later on at the end we just typed hello hackers and got our flag to proceed to the next module.

```bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ echo hello
hello
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ echo hello hackers
hello hackers
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Er3QjqO_HooM7j_VQgyzDPYOJUT.QX4YjM1wyN1QzNzEzW}
```

### My learnings 
We learnt the 'echo' command in the first place and how it accepts commands and argumengts as input and gives the output.

## Command History
This challenge allowed us to understand that and learn that the shell saves a history of every command that we invoke. 

### My Solution 
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QgjRryxrbHBOVm48tj-fW0coqEr.0lNzEzNxwyN1QzNzEzW}`
Simply by pressing the up arrow key we got our flag. 

```bash
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{QgjRryxrbHBOVm48tj-fW0coqEr.0lNzEzNxwyN1QzNzEzW}
```

### My learnings 
We learnt that the Linux commands are saved in history and we can access them by using the up/down aroow key.
